boro implemented some algorithms

# a little ü§è bit of context
I'v been reading [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844) (MIT Press) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest & Clifford Stein. This repo is my note taking.


# what's looking good:
* insertion-sort (go, python) is looking good
* stacks (python) is looking good
* hash (python)  is looking good enough, it only works for str (for now)

# what's junk:
* queue is a copy of stacks but the name is changed

# bisa
boro implemented some algorithms

# a little ü§è bit of context
I'v been reading Introduction to Algorithms (MIT Press) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest & Clifford Stein. Every code writter in this repo is my "note taking" from that book


# what's looking good:
* insertion-sort (go, python) is looking good
* stacks (python) is looking good
* hash (python)  is looking good enough, it only works for str (for now)

# what's junk:
* queue is a copy of stacks but the name is changed
